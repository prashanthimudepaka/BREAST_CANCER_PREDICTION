1. Project Overview (5 minutes)
Briefly introduce the project and its purpose.
Explain why you chose breast cancer prediction as the focus and how it can be beneficial.
2. Problem Statement & Dataset (10 minutes)
Describe the problem: early diagnosis of breast cancer and why it’s important.
Discuss the dataset you used (e.g., the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset).
Highlight the key features in the dataset and what they represent.
3. Technical Details (15 minutes)
Data Preprocessing: How did you handle missing values, normalization, or feature selection?
Machine Learning Model: Explain which model(s) you used (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or a Neural Network).
Training & Evaluation: Discuss model training, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall).
4. Web Application (10 minutes)
Backend: Walk through how Flask is used to create routes, handle user inputs, and connect with the ML model.
Frontend: Show how HTML/CSS is used to create a user-friendly form for inputs and display results.
Integration: Discuss how you linked the frontend and backend together to make the app functional.
5. Live Demo (10 minutes)
Walk through the app: Input some values, explain what each input field means, and demonstrate a prediction.
Show how the confidence score is displayed and interpret the result.
6. Challenges & Learnings (5 minutes)
Discuss any challenges you faced (e.g., model accuracy, deployment issues).
Share what you learned from the project and what you might improve if you had more time.
7. Q&A / Feedback (5-10 minutes)
Open the floor for questions, comments, or suggestions from the audience.
Tips to Keep it Engaging:
Use visuals like graphs, slides, or a quick diagram to explain the workflow.
Avoid getting too technical in any one section; keep it at a level that your audience can follow.
Show enthusiasm and passion—it makes a big difference in keeping people engaged!
With this structure, you should be able to cover all aspects of your project within 1 hour while maintaining a good balance between detail and clarity.
